# Quick Start

## Dataset Link 

The dataset has been uploaded at the following Google Drive link - [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n84pzErX1xo8O5NMB16vpIhiqJhuakho/view?usp=sharing)

After downloading this version of the dataset, extract it. 


## Running the code

Run the ```model.py``` as follows - 

```
python model.py
```
This will pickle models for for transcription and also print performance metrics. To run the version of the model without the onset predictions, use ```model_without_onsets.py```.
